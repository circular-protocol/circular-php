## CAVEATS

* Please note the following:
    * Error handling is very simplistic and should be tailored to your specific needs.
    * The fetch method in this PHP class does not behave exactly like the JavaScript fetch function especially regarding error handling.
      -- Consider replacing it with a more robust solution like Guzzle or CURL in a production environment.
